;; Using data-directed programming as an approach, we can transform it into:
(define (deriv exp var)
  (cond
    ((number? exp) 0)
    ((variable? exp) (if (same-variable? exp var) 1 0))

(define (operands exp)

;; a. Explain what was done above. Why canâ€™t we assimilate the predicates number? and variable? into the data-directed dispatch?

;; a.1.
;; The conditional statement was exchanged with a lookup in the table of operations to get a suitable operation for dealing with the expression.
;; This shortens the code significantly, because the logic how these operations are implemented is defined in the operations registered in the table of operations and not our current concern.
;; It also has the advantage of being able to separate concerns. One person might be responsible for writing the procedure for deriving a sum, another person might be responsible for writing the procedure for deriving a product and another one for a division.

;; a.2.
;; A derivation procedure could rely on their own representation of numbers. (?)
;; Maybe someone implements the derivation of complex numbers for example.
;; If we implemented this, we would have to change it, whenever someone implements an operation for a new representation of numbers.

;; b. Write the procedures for derivatives of sums and products, and the auxiliary code required to install them in the table used by the program above.

;; d. In this simple algebraic manipulator the type of an expression is the algebraic operator that binds it together. Suppose, however, we indexed the procedures in the opposite way, so that the dispatch line in deriv looked like:

;; ((get (operator exp) 'deriv) (operands exp) var)
;; What corresponding changes to the derivative system are required?

;; The order of arguments to the procedure put. We would simply fill the table with inverted dimensions. First the type of expression, then the operation we want to do on them.
