;; "Coercion" is the process of viewing data of a specific type as data of another type and acting accordingly.
;; For example an integer number might be viewed as a rational number and added to another rational number, by a procedure, which only can work with rational numbers.

;; Exercise 2.81
;; a. Louis Reasoner adds:
(define (scheme-number->scheme-number n) n)
(define (complex->complex z) z)
(put-coercion
  'scheme-number
  'scheme-number
  scheme-number->scheme-number)
(put-coercion 'complex 'complex complex->complex)

;; also we added
;; following added to Scheme-number package
(put
  'exp
  '(scheme-number scheme-number)
  (lambda (x y)
    (tag (expt x y))))
; using primitive expt

;; What happens if we then call the following for complex numbers?
(define (exp x y) (apply-generic 'exp x y))



;; TODO
;; b. Is Louis correct that something had to be done about coercion with arguments of the same type, or does apply-generic work correctly as is?
;; c. Modify apply-generic so that it doesnâ€™t try coercion if the two arguments have the same type.
